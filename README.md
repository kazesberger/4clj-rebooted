# 4clj-rebooted

#100DaysOfClojure sideproject for now but maybe this could be a proper reboot of www.4clojure.com.

I'm still quite the clj(s) noob, this project might just die before being finished.

## some ideas that i want to add to the 4clj you already know

these are quite old notes of mine when i initially gathered ideas for useful contributions to the original 4clojure:

* https
* resurrect PR for OpenId auth (or similar)
* improve user follow subscription (search/sort/performance/..) (there is a 2012-PR for this in parts too)
* issue/PRs: communication/grooming
* mb quick navigation to problems similar to the android app
* provide a better dev experience by (never leave ide/repl):
    * exposing problem-data via api
    * accept solution submissions via api
* mb upvote solutions
* multiple solutions
